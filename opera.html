        <h6>ACT I—Exterior of Castle Bunthorne</h6>
        <p><h6>SCENE: Exterior of Castle Bunthorne, the gateway to which is
            seen, R.U.E., and is approached by a drawbridge over a moat.
            A rocky eminence R. with steps down to the stage.  In front
            of it, a rustic bench, on which ANGELA is seated, with ELLA
            on her left.  Young Ladies wearing aesthetic draperies are
            grouped about the stage from R. to L.C., SAPHIR being near
            the L. end of the group.  The Ladies play on lutes, etc., as
            they sing, and all are in the last stage of despair.</h6></p>

                <p>If love is a thorn, they show no wit
                    Who foolishly hug and foster it.
                    If love is a weed, how simple they
                    Who gather it, day by day!
        
                    If love is a nettle that makes you smart,
                    Then why do you wear it next your heart?
                    And if it be none of these, say I,
                    Ah, why do you sit and sob and sigh?
        
                         Though ev'rywhere true love I see
                         A-coming to all, but not to me,
                         I cannot tell what this love may be!
                              For I am blithe and I am gay,
                              While they sit sighing night and day.</p></div>
