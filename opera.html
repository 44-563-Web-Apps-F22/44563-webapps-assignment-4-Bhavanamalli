        <h4>THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE</h4>
        <h6>ACT I—A rocky sea-shore on the coast of Cornwall</h6>
        <p><h6>SENCE:A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall.  In the
          distance is a calm sea, on which a schooner is lying at anchor.
          Rock L. sloping down to L.C. of stage.  Under these rocks is a
          cavern, the entrance to which is seen at first entrance L.  A
          natural arch of rock occupies the R.C. of the stage.  As the
          curtain rises groups of pirates are discovered — some drinking,
          some playing cards.  SAMUEL, the Pirate Lieutenant, is going from
          one group to another, filling the cups from a flask.  FREDERIC is
          seated in a despondent attitude at the back of the scene.  RUTH
          kneels at his feet.

        <h5>OPENING CHORUS</h5>

        <h6>ALL:</h6>     
        <p>Pour, O pour the pirate sherry;
          Fill, O fill the pirate glass;
         And, to make us more than merry
          Let the pirate bumper pass.</p> 
      
        <h6>SAMUEL:</h6>
        <p> For today our pirate 'prentice
          Rises from indentures freed;
     Strong his arm, and keen his scent is
          He's a pirate now indeed!
        </p> 
       <h6>ALL:</h6>     
       <p> Here's good luck to Fred'ric's ventures!
          Fred'ric's out of his indentures.</p> 
      
        <h6>SAMUEL: </h6>
        <p> Two and twenty, now he's rising,
          And alone he's fit to fly,
     Which we're bent on signalizing
          With unusual revelry.</p> 
      
        <h6>ALL:</h6>   
           <p>Here's good luck to Fred'ric's ventures!
               Fred'ric's out of his indentures.
          Pour, O pour the pirate sherry;
               Fill, O fill the pirate glass;
          And, to make us more than merry
               Let the pirate bumper pass.</p>
      
        <p>(FREDERIC rises and comes forward with PIRATE KING, who enters)</p>
      
       <h6> KING: </h6>   
       <p>Yes, Frederic, from to-day you rank as a full-blown
          member of our band.</p> 
        <h6>>ALL:</h6    
          <p> Hurrah!</p>

          <h5>Speech</h5>
          
  <h6>GIRLS:</h6>    
  <p>Though the moments quickly die,
     Greet them gaily as they fly.</p>

  <h6>KATE:</h6>     
  <p>Far away from toil and care,
     Revelling in fresh sea-air,
     Here we live and reign alone
     In a world that's all our own.
     Here, in this our rocky den,
     Far away from mortal men,
     We'll be queens, and make decrees—
     They may honour them who please.</p>

  <h6>GIRLS:</h6>   
  <p>We'll be queens, and make decrees—
     They may honour them who please.
     Let us gaily tread the measure, etc.</p> 

   <h6 class="KATE">KATE: </h6>  
   <p>What a picturesque spot! I wonder where we are!</p>  
   <h6>EDITH: </h6>  
   <p> And I wonder where Papa is.  We have left him ever so
     far behind.</p>
   <h6>ISABEL:</h6> 
   <p>Oh, he will be here presently! Remember poor Papa is
     not as young as we are, and we came over a rather
     difficult country.</p>  
  <h6>KATE: </h6>   
  <p> But how thoroughly delightful it is to be so entirely
     alone! Why, in all probability we are the first human
     beings who ever set foot on this enchanting spot.</p>
  <p> Except the mermaids—it's the very place for mermaids.</p>ISABEL:  
        
  

    <h5>SONG — RUTH</h5>
       
      <h6>RUTH: </h6>   
        <p> When Frederic was a little lad he proved so brave and
          daring,
     His father thought he'd 'prentice him to some career
          seafaring.
     I was, alas! his nurs'rymaid, and so it fell to my lot
     To take and bind the promising boy apprentice to a
          pilot —
     A life not bad for a hardy lad, though surely not a
          high lot,
     Though I'm a nurse, you might do worse than make your
          boy a pilot.
