        <h4>THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE</h4>
        <h6>ACT I—A rocky sea-shore on the coast of Cornwall</h6>
        <p><h6>SENCE:A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall.  In the
          distance is a calm sea, on which a schooner is lying at anchor.
          Rock L. sloping down to L.C. of stage.  Under these rocks is a
          cavern, the entrance to which is seen at first entrance L.  A
          natural arch of rock occupies the R.C. of the stage.  As the
          curtain rises groups of pirates are discovered — some drinking,
          some playing cards.  SAMUEL, the Pirate Lieutenant, is going from
          one group to another, filling the cups from a flask.  FREDERIC is
          seated in a despondent attitude at the back of the scene.  RUTH
          kneels at his feet.

        <h5>OPENING CHORUS</h5>

        <h6>ALL:</h6>     
        <p>Pour, O pour the pirate sherry;
          Fill, O fill the pirate glass;
         And, to make us more than merry
          Let the pirate bumper pass.</p> 
      
        <h6>SAMUEL:</h6>
        <p> For today our pirate 'prentice
          Rises from indentures freed;
     Strong his arm, and keen his scent is
          He's a pirate now indeed!
        </p> 
       <h6>ALL:</h6>     
       <p> Here's good luck to Fred'ric's ventures!
          Fred'ric's out of his indentures.</p> 
      
        <h6>SAMUEL: </h6>
        <p> Two and twenty, now he's rising,
          And alone he's fit to fly,
     Which we're bent on signalizing
          With unusual revelry.</p> 
      
        <h6>ALL:</h6>   
           <p>Here's good luck to Fred'ric's ventures!
               Fred'ric's out of his indentures.
          Pour, O pour the pirate sherry;
               Fill, O fill the pirate glass;
          And, to make us more than merry
               Let the pirate bumper pass.</p>
      
        <p>(FREDERIC rises and comes forward with PIRATE KING, who enters)</p>
      
       <h6> KING: </h6>   
       <p>Yes, Frederic, from to-day you rank as a full-blown
          member of our band.</p> 
        <h6>>ALL:</h6    
          <p> Hurrah!</p>

          <h5>Speech</h5>
          
  <h6>GIRLS:</h6>    
  <p>Though the moments quickly die,
     Greet them gaily as they fly.</p>

  <h6>KATE:</h6>     
  <p>Far away from toil and care,
     Revelling in fresh sea-air,
     Here we live and reign alone
     In a world that's all our own.
     Here, in this our rocky den,
     Far away from mortal men,
     We'll be queens, and make decrees—
     They may honour them who please.</p>

  <h6>GIRLS:</h6>   
  <p>We'll be queens, and make decrees—
     They may honour them who please.
     Let us gaily tread the measure, etc.</p> 

   <h6>KATE: </h6>  
   <p>What a picturesque spot! I wonder where we are!</p>  
   <h6>EDITH: </h6>  
   <p> And I wonder where Papa is.  We have left him ever so
     far behind.</p>
   <h6>ISABEL:</h6> 
   <p>Oh, he will be here presently! Remember poor Papa is
     not as young as we are, and we came over a rather
     difficult country.</p>  
  <h6>KATE: </h6>   
  <p> But how thoroughly delightful it is to be so entirely
     alone! Why, in all probability we are the first human
     beings who ever set foot on this enchanting spot.</p>
  <p> Except the mermaids—it's the very place for mermaids.</p>ISABEL:  
   <h6>KATE: </h6>  
   <p> Who are only human beings down to the waist</p>
   <h6>  EDITH: </h6>
      <p>And who can't be said strictly to set foot anywhere.
          Tails they may, but feet they cannot. </p>
<h6>KATE: </h6>    
<p>But what shall we do until Papa and the servants arrive
     with the luncheon?</p>
  <h6>EDITH:</h6>    
  <p>We are quite alone, and the sea is as smooth as glass.
     Suppose we take off our shoes and stockings and paddle?</p>
  <h6>ALL:</h6>     
  <p>Yes, yes!  The very thing!</p>   
  <p>(They prepare to carry, out
     the suggestion. They have all taken off one shoe, when
     FREDERIC comes forward from cave.)</p>

    <h5>SONG — RUTH</h5>
       
      <h6>RUTH: </h6>   
        <p> When Frederic was a little lad he proved so brave and
          daring,
     His father thought he'd 'prentice him to some career
          seafaring.
     I was, alas! his nurs'rymaid, and so it fell to my lot
     To take and bind the promising boy apprentice to a
          pilot —
     A life not bad for a hardy lad, though surely not a
          high lot,
     Though I'm a nurse, you might do worse than make your
          boy a pilot.
     </p>.
        <h6>RUTH:</h6>    <p>Oh, pardon!  Frederic, pardon!</p>   <p>(Kneels)</p>
        <h6>FREDERIC:</h6>
        <p>Rise, sweet one, I have long pardoned you.</p> 
        <p> (Ruth
          rises)</p> 
        <h6>RUTH:</h6>     
        <p>The two words were so much alike!</p>
        <h6>FREDERIC:</h6>
        <p>They were.  They still are, though years have rolled
          over their heads.  But this afternoon my obligation
          ceases.  Individually, I love you all with affection
          unspeakable; but, collectively, I look upon you with a
          disgust that amounts to absolute detestation.  Oh! pity
          me, my beloved friends, for such is my sense of duty
          that, once out of my indentures, I shall feel myself
          bound to devote myself heart and soul to your
          extermination!</p> 
       <h6>ALL:</h6>      
       <p>Poor lad — poor lad!</p>  
       <p>(All weep)</p> 
        <h6>KING:</h6>    
        <p> Well, Frederic, if you conscientiously feel that it is
          your duty to destroy us, we cannot blame you for acting
          on that conviction.  Always act in accordance with the
          dictates of your conscience, my boy, and chance the
          consequences.
