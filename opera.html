     <h4>THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE</h4>
     <h6>ACT I—A rocky sea-shore on the coast of Cornwall</h6>
     <p>
     <h6>SENCE:A rocky seashore on the coast of Cornwall. In the
          distance is a calm sea, on which a schooner is lying at anchor.
          Rock L. sloping down to L.C. of stage. Under these rocks is a
          cavern, the entrance to which is seen at first entrance L. A
          natural arch of rock occupies the R.C. of the stage. As the
          curtain rises groups of pirates are discovered — some drinking,
          some playing cards. SAMUEL, the Pirate Lieutenant, is going from
          one group to another, filling the cups from a flask. FREDERIC is
          seated in a despondent attitude at the back of the scene. RUTH
          kneels at his feet.

     <h6 class="KATE">KATE:</h6>
     <p class="speech">Far away from toil and care,
          Revelling in fresh sea-air,
          Here we live and reign alone
          In a world that's all our own.
          Here, in this our rocky den,
          Far away from mortal men,
          We'll be queens, and make decrees—
          They may honour them who please.</p>

     <p class="speech">What a picturesque spot! I wonder where we are!</p>
     <h6 class="EDITH">EDITH: </h6>
     <p class="speech"> And I wonder where Papa is. We have left him ever so

     <h6 class="ISABEL">ISABEL:</h6>
     <p class="speech">Oh, he will be here presently! Remember poor Papa is
          not as young as we are, and we came over a rather
          difficult country.</p>
     <h6 class="KATE">KATE: </h6>
     <p class="speech"> But how thoroughly delightful it is to be so entirely
          alone! Why, in all probability we are the first human
          beings who ever set foot on this enchanting spot.</p>

     <h5 class="song">SONG — RUTH</h5>
     <h6 class="RUTH">RUTH: </h6>
     <p> When Frederic was a little lad he proved so brave and
          daring,
          His father thought he'd 'prentice him to some career
          seafaring.
          I was, alas! his nurs'rymaid, and so it fell to my lot
          To take and bind the promising boy apprentice to a
          pilot —
          A life not bad for a hardy lad, though surely not a
          high lot,
          Though I'm a nurse, you might do worse than make your
          boy a pilot.
