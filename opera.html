        <h4>PATIENCE</h4>
        <h6>ACT I—Exterior of Castle Bunthorne</h6>
        <p><h6>SCENE: Exterior of Castle Bunthorne, the gateway to which is
            seen, R.U.E., and is approached by a drawbridge over a moat.
            A rocky eminence R. with steps down to the stage.  In front
            of it, a rustic bench, on which ANGELA is seated, with ELLA
            on her left.  Young Ladies wearing aesthetic draperies are
            grouped about the stage from R. to L.C., SAPHIR being near
            the L. end of the group.  The Ladies play on lutes, etc., as
            they sing, and all are in the last stage of despair.</h6></p>
            <p>
                <h6>ELLA : The love of maidens is, to him, as interesting as the
                taxes!<br>
              
                SAPHIR:  Would that it were!  He pays his taxes.<br>
              
                ANGELA : And cherishes the receipts!
              
                [Enter LADY JANE, L.U.E.]<br>
              
                SAPHIR:  Happy receipts!  [All sigh heavily]<br>
              
                JANE [L.C., suddenly]: Fools!  [They start, and turn to her]<br>
              
                ANGELA:  I beg your pardon?<br>
              
                JANE : Fools and blind!  The man loves — wildly loves!<br>
              
                ANGELA : But whom?  None of us!<br>
              
                JANE:  No, none of us.  His weird fancy has lighted, for the
                nonce, on Patience, the village milkmaid!<br>
              
                SAPHIR:  On Patience?  Oh, it cannot be!<br>
              
                JANE:  Bah!  But yesterday I caught him in her dairy, eating fresh
                butter with a tablespoon.  Today he is not well!<br>
              
                SAPHIR:  But Patience boasts that she has never loved — that love
                is, to her, a sealed book!  Oh, he cannot be serious!<br>
              
                JANE:  `Tis but a fleeting fancy — `twill quickly wear away.
                [aside, coming down-stage]  Oh, Reginald, if you but knew what a
                wealth of golden love is waiting for you, stored up in this
                rugged old bosom of mine, the milkmaid's triumph would be short
                indeed!
              
                [PATIENCE appears on an eminence, R.  She looks down with pity on
                     the despondent Ladies.]
                        No. 2. Still brooding on their mad infatuation!
                                          (Recitative)
                             Patience, Saphir, Angela, and Maidens<br>
              
                PATIENCE : Still brooding on their mad infatuation!
                               I thank thee, Love, thou comest not to me!
                          Far happier I, free from thy ministration,
                               Than dukes or duchesses who love can be!<br>
              
                SAPHIR  [looking up] : `Tis Patience — happy girl!  Loved by a
                poet!<br>
              
                PATIENCE:  Your pardon, ladies.  I intrude upon you!  [Going]<br>
              
                ANGELA:  Nay, pretty child, come hither.  [PATIENCE descends.]  Is
                it true that you have never loved?<br>
              
                PATIENCE:  Most true indeed.<br>
              
                SOPRANOS:  Most marvelous!<br>
              
                ALTOS:  And most deplorable!
                              I cannot tell what this love may be
                                             (Solo)
                                            Patience<br>
              
                PATIENCE   :    I cannot tell what this love may be
                [L.C.]         That cometh to all but not to me.
                               It cannot be kind as they'd imply,
                               Or why do these ladies sigh?
              
                               It cannot be joy and rapture deep,
                               Or why do these gentle ladies weep?
                               It cannot be blissful as `tis said,
                               Or why are their eyes so wondrous red?
              
                                    Though ev'rywhere true love I see
                                    A-coming to all, but not to me,
                                    I cannot tell what this love may be!
                                        For I am blithe and I am gay,
                                        While they sit sighing night and day.
              
                          PATIENCE                          ALL
              
                For I am blithe and I am gay,     Yes, she is blithe and she is
                                                       gay,
                Think of the gulf `twixt          Yes, she is blithe and
                     them and me,                      she is gay,
                Think of the gulf `twixt them,    Yes, she is blithe and
                and me,                                and she is gay,
                Fal lal la la la la la la la la la la la la la
                     la la la la la la la la la la la la,
                and miserie!                           Ah, miserie!
              
                            [She dances across R. and back to R.C.]<br>
              
                PATIENCE:  If love is a thorn, they show no wit
                          Who foolishly hug and foster it.
                          If love is a weed, how simple they
                          Who gather it, day by day!
              
                          If love is a nettle that makes you smart,
                          Then why do you wear it next your heart?
                          And if it be none of these, say I,
                          Ah, why do you sit and sob and sigh?
              
                               Though ev'rywhere true love I see
                               A-coming to all, but not to me,
                               I cannot tell what this love may be!
                                    For I am blithe and I am gay,
                                    While they sit sighing night and day.
              
                          PATIENCE                          ALL
              
                For I am blithe and I             Yes, she is blithe and she is
                     am gay,                           gay,
                Think of the gulf `twixt          Yes, she is blithe and she is
                     them and me,                      gay,
                Think of the gulf `twixt          Yes, she is blithe and she is
                     them and me,                      gay,
                Fal lal la la la la la la la la la la la la la
                     la la la la la la la la la la la la,
                     and miserie!                           Ah, miserie!<br>
              
                ANGELA : Ah, Patience, if you have never loved, you have never
                known true happiness!  [All sigh.]<br>
              
                PATIENCE [C.]:  But the truly happy always seem to have so much on
                their minds.  The truly happy never seem quite well.<br>
              
                JANE [coming L.C.]:  There is a transcendentality of delirium —
                an acute accentuation of supremest ecstasy — which the earthy
                might easily mistake for indigestion.  But it is not indigestion
                — it is aesthetic transfiguration!  [to the others.]  Enough of
                babble.  Come!<br>
              
                PATIENCE [stopping her as she turns to go up C.] : But stay, I
                have some news for you.  The 35th Dragoon Guards have halted in
                the village, and are even now on their way to this very spot.<br>
              
                ANGELA : The 35th Dragoon Guards!<br>
              
                SAPHIR: They are fleshly men, of full habit!<br>
              
                ELLA : We care nothing for Dragoon Guards!<br>

                PATIENCE : But, bless me, you were all engaged to them a year ago!<br>

                SAPHIR:  A year ago!</h6></p>
        <h6>ACT II-A Glade</h6>
        <p><h6>SCENE: A wooded glade, with a view of open country in the
            background.  The chorus of MAIDENS is heard singing in the
            distance.  JANE is discovered leaning on a violoncello,
            which she has propped up on a tree-stump, L., and upon which
            she will presently accompany herself.  As the Chorus ends,
            she speaks.</h6></p>
            <p> <h6>ANGELA : Sir, will it please you read to us?<br>

                GROS [sighing]:  Yes, child, if you will.  What shall I read?<br>
              
                ANGELA:  One of your own poems.<br>
              
                GROS: One of my own poems?  Better not, my child.  They will not
                cure thee of thy love.  [All sigh.]<br>
              
                ELLA  :Mr. Bunthorne used to read us a poem of his own every day.<br>
              
                SAPHIR : And, to do him justice, he read them extremely well.<br>
              
                GROS:  Oh, did he so?  Well, who am I that I should take upon
                myself to withhold my gifts from you?  What am I but a trustee?
                Here is a decalet — a pure and simple thing, a very daisy — a
                babe might understand it.  To appreciate it, it is not necessary
                to think of anything at all.<br>
              
                ANGELA : Let us think of nothing at all!<br>
              
                GROS. [reciting]:
              
                          Gentle Jane was as good as gold,
                          She always did as she was told;
                          She never spoke when her mouth was full,
                          Or caught bluebottles their legs to pull,
                          Or spilt plum jam on her nice new frock,
                          Or put white mice in the eight-day clock,
                          Or vivisected her last new doll,
                          Or fostered a passion for alcohol.
                     And when she grew up she was given in marriage
                     To a first-class earl who keeps his carriage!<br>
              
                GROS:  I believe I am right in saying that there is not one word
                in that decalet which is calculated to bring the blush of shame
                to the cheek of modesty.<br>
              
                ANGELA:  Not one; it is purity itself.<br>
              
                GROS: Here's another.
              
                     Teasing Tom was a very bad boy,
                     A great big squirt was his favourite toy
                     He put live shrimps in his father's boots,
                     And sewed up the sleeves of his Sunday suits;
                     He punched his poor little sisters' heads,
                     And cayenne-peppered their four-post beds;
                     He plastered their hair with cobbler's wax,
                     And dropped hot halfpennies down their backs.
                          The consequence was he was lost totally,
                          And married a girl in the corps de bally!
              
                             [The MAIDENS express intense horror.]<br>
              
                ANGELA : Marked you how grandly — how relentlessly — the damning
                catalogue of crime strode on, till Retribution, like a poised
                hawk, came swooping down upon the Wrong-Doer?  Oh, it was
                terrible!  [All shudder.]<br>
              
                ELLA : Oh, sir, you are indeed a true poet, for you touch our
                hearts, and they go out to you!<br>
              
                GROS. [aside] : This is simply cloying.  [aloud] Ladies, I am
                sorry to appear ungallant, but this is Saturday, and you have
                been following me about ever since Monday.  I should like the
                usual half-holiday.  I shall take it as a personal favour if you
                will kindly allow me to close early to-day.<br>
              
                SAPHIR : Oh, sir, do not send us from you!<br>
              
                GROS.:  Poor, poor girls!  It is best to speak plainly.  I know
                that I am loved by you, but I never can love you in return, for
                my heart is fixed elsewhere!  Remember the fable of the Magnet
                and the Churn.<br>
              
                ANGELA [wildly]:  But we don't know the fable of the Magnet and
                the Churn<br>!
              
                GROS. : Don't you?  Then I will sing it to you.
                            No. 13. A magnet hung in a hardware shop
                                       (Solo and Chorus)
                                     Grosvenor and Maidens<br>
              
                GROSVENOR  :    A magnet hung in a hardware shop,
                               And all around was a loving crop
                               Of scissors and needles, nails and knives,
                               Offering love for all their lives;
                               But for iron the magnet felt no whim,
                               Though he charmed iron, it charmed not him;
                               From needles and nails and knives he'd turn,
                               For he'd set his love on a Silver Churn!<br>
              
                MAIDENS    :         A Silver Churn!<br>
              
                GROSVENOR   :        A Silver Churn!
              
                                        His most aesthetic,
                                        Very magnetic
                                    Fancy took this turn—

                          The penknives felt "shut up", no doubt,
                          The scissors declared themselves "cut out",

                fascination that I seem to exercise over all I come across?  A
